TAKEAWAYS
Net Interest Income
-- $300 million in net interest income for Q2 2025, a company record, up $43 million or 17% year-over-year and $14 million sequentially, reflecting improvements in both volume and spread.
Net Interest Margin
-- Net interest margin was 3.04% in Q2 2025, up 7 basis points sequentially and 29 basis points year-over-year, driven by 5 basis points of higher earning asset yields and a 4 basis point decrease in liability costs.
Loan Growth
-- Total loans increased 1% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year, or nearly 6% excluding the January loan sale. Commercial and industrial balances grew by $356 million and are up over $700 million year-to-date.
Deposit Trends
-- Total and core customer deposits declined modestly due to expected seasonality but each rose more than 4% year-over-year.
Non-Interest Income
-- $67 million in non-interest income, up 14% from Q1 2025, with the increase partly due to the absence of a prior mortgage sale loss. Year-over-year, non-interest income grew by 3%.
Non-Interest Expense
-- $209 million, down $1 million from the prior quarter, as declines in occupancy and FDIC assessment were offset by higher personnel and business development costs.
Efficiency Ratio
-- Fell below 56%, the lowest level since early 2023, affirming ongoing operating leverage efforts.
Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE)
-- Return on tangible common equity was 12.96%, up 62 basis points sequentially, indicating stronger capital returns.
Capital
-- CET1 ratio reached 10.2%, up 9 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 52 basis points year-over-year; TCE ratio increased to 8.06%.
Credit Quality
-- Non-accrual loans decreased 16%, and net charge-offs were $13 million (0.17% of average loans), which, according to management, remain in line with prior quarters.
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
-- Rose to $412 million, increasing by $5 million, with the ACL ratio at 1.35% (up 1 basis point sequentially).
Guidance for 2025
-- Management expects 5%-6% total loan growth, 4%-5% core deposit growth, 14%-15% net interest income growth (assuming three Fed rate cuts), 1%-2% non-interest income growth (excluding nonrecurring items), and 4%-5% non-interest expense growth for 2025.
Strategic Plan Progress
-- "Best organic checking household growth we've seen since we began tracking nearly a decade ago," per Harmening, highlighting customer acquisition momentum and asset-mix remixing toward higher-yielding C&I loans.
Commercial Pipeline and Hiring
-- Commercial deposit pipeline increased by $500 million over the past twelve months and $200 million over the prior ninety days; hiring momentum continues with production shift expected as RM non-competes expire.
CRE Portfolio
-- CRE construction loans grew by $140 million, but net outflows in CRE investor loans were $227 million; payoff activity picked up late in the quarter, and office asset stress is "down considerably" from prior periods.
Balance Sheet Sensitivity
-- Asset sensitivity reduced, with a 100 basis point rate cut scenario expected to impact net interest income by approximately 1%.
SUMMARY
Associated Bank
 
(
ASB
 
+0.29%
)
 management reiterated confidence in achieving full-year 2025 growth targets for loans, deposits, and net interest income, citing a strong C&I pipeline, high customer satisfaction, and improved household growth as key drivers. Executives indicated that incremental margin expansion is expected to come from continued remixing of the asset base -- particularly C&I growth -- while maintaining discipline in deposit pricing strategy, as discussed in Q2 2025 and in forward-looking statements regarding margin and asset mix. Capital ratios improved sequentially and year-over-year, supporting management's stated intention to keep CET1 within a 10%-10.5% range. The company emphasized its lower operating efficiency ratio and signaled positive operating leverage is sustainable into 2026.
Harmening noted, "Our quarterly net interest income of $300 million was the strongest number we've seen in our company's history."
Meyer said, "Based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth and mix, deposit betas, and Fed action, we now expect to drive net interest income growth of between 14% and 15% in 2025."
Harmening clarified that while M&A is not off the table, it would have to be a really good fit. Strategically, it'd have to be a good fit financially. It'd have to be a good fit culturally.
The company expects its investments in new commercial RMs and technology to drive deposit and loan growth worth we think a few $100 million over the next 12–18 months, with new business expected as non-compete agreements expire.
Management attributed the increase in the ACL for C&I to portfolio growth rather than heightened risk, and reported that net credit migration in CRE and C&I is viewed as normal movement within risk ratings.
Ahern stated that "office [CRE] continues to evolve probably in a better spot than it was a couple years ago," and stressed office credit stress had declined considerably, supported by recent asset payoffs.
Securities plus cash to total assets rose to 23.4%; management plans to maintain this ratio within the 22%-24% range throughout 2025 as the AFS portfolio continues to grow moderately.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Andy Harmening:
 Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining our second-quarter earnings call. This is Andy Harmening. I'm joined once again by our Chief Financial Officer, Derek Meyer, and our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern. I'll start off by sharing some highlights from the quarter. From there, Derek will cover the income statement and capital trends, and Pat will provide an update on credit. Throughout the first half of this year, we remain focused squarely on landing the plane with regards to our strategic plan. The momentum from actions we've taken over the past several quarters has continued to transform our company in several important ways.
First, we're leveraging a best-in-class value proposition to grow and deepen our customer base organically. In Q2, we posted the best organic checking household growth we've seen since we began tracking nearly a decade ago. Second, we're driving loan growth while remixing our asset base. With over $700 million in C&I growth in the first half of 2025, we are well on our way to exceeding the $1.2 billion target we set for the year. These balances are replacing lower-yielding resi balances as they roll off the balance sheet. This ongoing mix shift is driving stronger profitability. Our quarterly net interest income of $300 million was the strongest number we've seen in our company's history.
Finally, our enhanced profitability profile enables us to accrete capital while still supporting balance sheet growth. We added another nine basis points to CET1 capital in Q2. We have added 19 basis points of CET1 so far this year, following the completion of our balance sheet repositioning. As always, credit discipline remains a focus for us given the uncertain macro backdrop. We continue to proactively manage our portfolios and meet with customers to stay on top of any emerging risks. We remain well-positioned to play offense in the back half of this year, thanks to the stability of our markets and the building momentum of our strategic plan.
We also remain well-positioned to play defense if necessary, thanks to our disciplined approach to credit. With that, I'd like to walk through some additional highlights for the quarter beginning on Slide two. For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $0.65 per share. Total loans grew by 1% quarter over quarter and by 3% versus Q2 of 2024. Adjusted for the loan sale we completed in January, total loans in Q2 were up by nearly 6% versus Q2 of 2024. Our loan growth has been led by commercial as our middle market expansion continues to gain momentum.
We added another $356 million of C&I loans in Q2, and we've now grown C&I loans by over $700 million through the first six months of 2025. As expected, our Q2 deposit levels were impacted by seasonal outflows. But compared to the same period a year ago, core customer deposits were up 4.3%. We remain confident in our full-year outlook for customer deposit growth thanks to our steadily improving household growth trends, our commercial RM hires, and the seasonal inflows we typically see in the back half of the year.
Moving to the income statement, our Q2 net interest income of $300 million was the strongest mark we've seen in company history and was up $43 million or 17% versus the same period a year ago. We also posted non-interest income of $67 million during the quarter, which was up 3% versus Q2 of last year. Total non-interest expense finished down slightly from the prior quarter at $209 million here in Q2. Driving positive operating leverage continues to be a primary focus as we execute our plan. We also continue to monitor credit quality closely. In Q2, our non-accrual loans were down 16%. We booked 17 basis points of net charge-offs. We added $18 million in provision.
Finally, we posted a return on tangible common equity of 12.96% in Q2, a 62 basis point improvement from Q1. Moving to slide three, the strategic actions we've taken have put us in a position to enhance our profitability by growing and remixing both sides of our balance sheet. We're doing just that. You can see it in commercial, where C&I balances have grown by over $700 million year to date, with pipelines continuing to build and several more non-competes from recently hired RMs set to expire in the coming months. We expect our momentum to carry into the back half of the year and into 2026.
These higher-yielding, relationship-focused C&I loans are replacing lower-yielding resi mortgage loans that have historically been concentrated on our balance sheet. As those balances continue to roll off, we've been able to decrease that concentration and diversify our asset base. This dynamic sets us up to drive more profitable growth without sacrificing our disciplined approach to credit. In Q2, our net interest margin climbed above 3%, and we posted record NII. We see additional opportunity ahead as we continue to grow and remix our asset base while supporting that growth primarily through lower-cost customer deposits. On slide four, we highlight our loan trends for the second quarter.
Total average quarterly loans increased by nearly $400 million versus Q1, and while total period loans increased by 1%, we $300 million point to point. In both cases, this growth was led by C&I. CRE construction loans grew by $140 million during the quarter, but this growth was more than offset by $227 million in net outflows in the CRE investor bucket. After a light first quarter of payoffs, we saw payoff activity in CRE pick up towards the end of the second quarter, and we expect this activity to remain elevated over the remainder of the year. Finally, auto finance balances grew by $91 million in Q2 as we've continued to diversify our consumer book.
As such, we continue to expect total bank loan growth of 5% to 6% for the year. Moving to Slide five, total deposits and core customer deposits both dipped slightly during the quarter due to seasonality we typically see in the spring. However, both total deposits and core customer deposits are up more than 4% as compared to the same period a year ago. This reflects our efforts to attract and deepen customer relationships with a best-in-class value proposition. It also is a reflection of the RMs we've hired and our sharpened focus on whole relationships in commercial. We're confident in our ability to grow core customer deposits in the back half of the year for three reasons.
First, our consumer value proposition gives us an engine to attract and deepen customer relationships sustainably over time. In fact, here in Q2, we just booked the strongest organic primary checking household growth numbers we've seen since we began tracking a decade ago. Secondly, our sharpened focus on commercial deposits is gaining momentum, with pipelines growing, RM non-competes expiring, and the addition of a new deposit vertical. Finally, as we saw in 2024, our annual deposit growth is historically weighted towards the back half of the calendar year. Ultimately, we expect our efforts to drive growth in lower-cost core customer deposit categories that enable us to further decrease our reliance on wholesale funding sources over time.
Recent pipeline and household trends give us confidence in our growth outlook for the year, and as such, we continue to expect core deposit growth by 4% to 5% in 2025. With that, I'll pass it to Derek to discuss our income statement and capital trends. Thanks, Andy. I'll start with yield trends on Slide six.
Derek Meyer:
 In the second quarter, our net interest margin of 3.04% was driven by a five-basis-point increase in earning asset yields and a four-basis-point decrease in interest-bearing liability costs. We saw a slight uptick across the board in most asset categories. This uptick was led by the commercial business category, which increased by seven basis points versus Q1. On the liability side, total interest-bearing deposit cost decreased to 2.78% in Q2, a 13 basis point decrease from the prior quarter and a 52 basis point decrease versus Q2 of 2024. We remain pleased with our ability to reprice deposits downward over the past several quarters, particularly the high-rate categories such as CDs.
On Slide seven, our second quarter net interest income of $300 million increased by $14 million versus the prior quarter and $43 million versus the same period a year ago. Our net interest margin of 3.04% expanded by seven basis points versus Q1 and 29 basis points versus the same period a year ago. Based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth and mix, deposit betas, and Fed action, we now expect to drive net interest income growth of between 14% and 15% in 2025. This forecast assumes three rate cuts in 2025.
Moving to Slide eight, we continue to feel well-positioned for any potential Fed rate changes that may materialize in the coming months, thanks to our modestly asset-sensitive balance sheet. We've kept funding obligations short to maintain repricing flexibility. We've maintained received fixed swap balances of approximately $2.45 billion, and we've built a $3 billion fixed-rate auto book with low prepayment risk and strong credit characteristics. These actions have reduced our asset sensitivity over time, with the down 100 ramp scenario now representing about a 1% impact to our NII as of Q2. We expect to maintain this modestly sensitive position going forward.
On Slide nine, our securities book increased to $9 billion in Q2 as we continue to modestly build our AFS portfolio. The overall yield in our investment securities portfolio increased two basis points from the prior quarter to 4.24%. Our securities plus cash to total assets ratio climbed to 23.4% for the quarter. We expect to manage this ratio in the 22% to 24% range throughout 2025. Our non-interest income trends for the quarter are highlighted on Slide 10. We posted total non-interest income of $67 million in Q2, a 14% increase over Q1 that was largely driven by the $7 million loss on mortgage sale we recognized in the prior quarter.
Relative to the same period a year ago, our non-interest income increased 3%. As compared to Q1, fee-based revenues, capital markets, and mortgage banking income ticked higher, and this growth was partially offset by a decrease in BOLI income. In 2025, we now expect non-interest income to grow by 1% to 2% after excluding the nonrecurring items that impacted our fourth quarter 2024 and first quarter 2025 results from the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. Moving to Slide 11, second quarter expenses of $209 million decreased $1 million versus Q1.
Within our expense base, quarterly decreases in occupancy, technology, FDIC assessment, and other non-interest expense were partially offset by increases in personnel, business development, and legal and professional costs. Our efficiency ratio dipped below 56%, which is the lowest level we've seen since early 2023. We continue to invest in people and strategies to support our growth plans, but as we've said previously, driving positive operating leverage continues to be a primary focus for our company. Based on our latest forecast, we now expect total non-interest expense growth of between 4% and 5% in 2025, off of our adjusted 2024 base. The increase was largely attributed to variable comp benefits expense and OREO.
On slide 12, we once again saw capital ratios increase across the board in Q2. Our TCE ratio of 8.06% in Q2 was up 10 basis points versus the prior quarter and up 88 basis points versus Q2 of 2024. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.2% as of Q2, a nine basis point increase relative to the prior quarter and a 52 basis point increase versus the same period a year ago. Based on our expectations for growth in 2025 and current market conditions, we continue to expect to maintain CET1 within a range of 10% to 10.5% for the year. I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality.
Thanks, Derek. I'll start with an allowance update on slide 13. We utilized the Moody's May 2025 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the higher interest rate environment. The baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes,
Pat Ahern:
 slower but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market, continued elevated levels of inflation, and continued monitoring of ongoing market developments and tariff negotiations. Our ACLL increased by $5 million in Q2 to finish the quarter at $412 million, with increases in commercial and business lending, CRE construction, and other consumer categories, partially offset by decreases in CRE investor and mortgage. The increase in commercial largely stemmed from a combination of loan growth plus normal movement within risk rating categories. Our ACL ratio increased by one basis point from the prior quarter to 1.35%. On slide 14, we continue to review our portfolios closely given ongoing uncertainty in the macro picture.
But we maintain a high degree of confidence in our loan portfolios and continue to see solid performance in Q2. Total delinquencies increased slightly to $52 million in Q2, with an uptick in the 90-plus bucket, partially offset by a decrease in the thirty to eighty-nine day bucket. The increase in the 90-plus category was a timing issue of one credit that was in the process of payoff via a sale. This carried over to the first week of July with full repayment.
Pat Ahern:
 Total criticized loans increased slightly versus Q1, with increases in the special mention and substandard categories partially offset by a decrease in nonaccrual loans. Much of this increase was driven by migration within CRE and C&I categories as we continue our philosophy of a proactive and conservative approach relative to credit risk ratings adhering within the current industry guidance. We do not feel that recent trends in this category are an indication of a noteworthy shift in the credit profile of the portfolio, nor do they represent an increased risk of loss. We continue focused portfolio deep dives on an ongoing basis and do not see a systemic shift in our commercial portfolios.
In fact, we continue to see resolutions with some of our more stressed credits, and liquidity remains present in the market in terms of both payoffs and loan re-margin. Balances in the non-accrual category were
Derek Meyer:
 down $22 million versus Q1 and $41 million versus the same period a year ago. Finally, we booked $13 million in net charge-offs during the quarter and $18 million in provision. Our net charge-off ratio increased by five basis points to 0.17%. All three of these numbers remain squarely in line with the figures we've seen over the past several quarters. In summary, our credit metrics continue to give us confidence that what we've seen to date is a handful of credits migrating within our rating system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters.
Overall, outside of these specific situations, we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity we've seen across the bank. In response specifically to tariffs and the ongoing trade policy negotiations, after our initial targeted portfolio reviews in April, we remain in close contact with clients as the trade policy discussions continue. I would note that clients have been planning for tariff changes for some time, and we feel comfortable with the positioning of strategies and the ability to execute when more clarity exists. Going forward, we remain diligent in monitoring other credit stressors in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects the impact of ongoing inflation pressures and shifting labor markets, to name just a few economic concerns.
In addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio, including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide. We expect any future provision adjustments will continue to reflect changes to risk rates, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality. With that, I will now pass it back to Andy for closing remarks.
Andy Harmening:
 Thanks, Pat. In summary, we're pleased with our progress over the first half of the year. We continue to feel well-positioned to build on our momentum in the back half of the year. And that's primarily due
Daniel Tamayo:
 Thank you.
Operator:
 We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Daniel. Maybe just starting on the deposits, I guess the seasonal decline caught us by a little bit of surprise this quarter even though maybe it shouldn't have. But, you know, just kind of back of the envelope here, it looks like to get to the guidance for the core customer deposit growth for '25, you need about $1.6 billion in the back half. So correct me if I'm wrong on that. But
Andy Harmening:
 Yeah, Daniel. So this is a little bit like a movie you've already seen. In fact, I mean, I'm not gonna say we forecasted this to the dollar, but we're pretty close. So when we look at the second half of the year, a big piece of it is seasonal. We have three or four customers that every year, they go down during this period. And it's actually about a $100 million better if you look at the trend from the prior year. What's different going into the second half of this year is we have a commercial pipeline report on deposits. That pipe has gone up $500 million in the last twelve months.
Interestingly, though, it's gone up $200 million in the last ninety days. So we have that as a backdrop. Starting in August and September, the vertical that we hired people for the technology fixes that we need to launch that. Those two things go in place. Over the course of twelve to eighteen months, that'll work be worth we think a few $100 million in growth to us. We actually hit household growth of 2% in the first half of the year. As you probably know, you don't immediately get the deposits in those. Those come in thirty, sixty, ninety days after you have it. We've not had that kind of trend in the past.
We started at negative one to two. We went to zero. We went to positive one. Now we're at two. And then you look at our customer satisfaction, which is the lead-in indicator as to what you're gonna run off. It's as high as it's ever been in our company. So we look at the second half of the year and we say, gosh, if we're just average last year, we're gonna hit the numbers that we forecasted. We don't feel like we're average to last year. So whether we get that additional lift in the second half of 2025, or we get the additional lift in 2026, we see a path for where it's coming to us.
So the forecast itself, we think, is pretty disciplined and pretty right on line with what we've seen in the prior year. Terrific. Thanks for that.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Is it fair to say that the increase on the total deposit guide relative to core deposit is just well, I let me ask you, what drove that increase?
Derek Meyer:
 Yep. Dan, this is Derek. That's just wholesale funding and brokered CDs. So that's a GAAP number, but what we're focused in on is the customer number that Andy is referring to. And we were right on budget the whole both first and second quarter. So for us, this has not been a surprise when we're sort of right on schedule, which is why we're pretty confident.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Okay. But the overall balance sheet is just expected to be slightly larger than and that's funding kind of securities or cash then. The way to think about it. That's that's well, that's exactly right. And, it's a little bit of more CDs or brokered CDs versus FHLB? So you have to if you're gonna give a gap guidance, then you have to include that. That's all.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Understood.
Derek Meyer:
 Understood. Okay. And then maybe one for Pat. This is just kind of question, I think, that should be asked every few quarters. If you could just give us kind of an update on the office CRE portfolio. You give a lot of good color in the slide deck. But, you know, just curious kind of if you could give some color around how you see that portfolio, what trends look like, you know, if there's a differentiation between the A and the B that you talk about, the class there. And then if you have a number for participations, if you do any of that with the office portfolio, that'd be helpful as well.
Pat Ahern:
 Yeah. I would say overall, you know, office continues to evolve probably in a better spot than it was a couple years ago. And I think the clients that we're working with who have addressed their assets and have been proactive in improving and providing amenities that the market is looking for have benefited, and that's what we're seeing in our portfolio. Certainly not completely out of the woods in terms of CRE as an office as an asset class. And I think the industry would agree with that. But, you know, the way we're down considerably in what we would deem kind of the more stressed office credits in the portfolio. We've had a fair amount of exits.
In fact, the one payoff from the delinquency I noted was a CRE office deal that sold. So I think we feel confident where we're at right now, and we just continue to watch it. Because that's still an evolving story, as you know, with return to office and where the assets are performing. But and I you know, in terms of SNC, terms of office, I don't have a number off the top of my head. Most of the stuff we're doing there is gonna be direct with sponsors we've worked with for a long, long time. We don't get involved in a lot of big banks, SNC deals in the, with the office class.
That's why we don't have a lot of downtown urban exposure there.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Got it. Okay. Very helpful. That's all I had. Thanks very much, guys.
Andy Harmening:
 Thank you.
Derek Meyer:
 Thank you.
Operator:
 Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefert with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Scott Siefert:
 Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Derek, was hoping you could help to kind of codify where the margins could go and the puts and takes to get us there. I remember like earlier in the year, we sort of talked about a call it, a 3% margin with some upside if rates stayed elevated. But, you know, now it feels and correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like remixing, within loan portfolio could be as powerful a factor as the level of rates. So just curious how you're thinking about all the kind of all the things sloshing around in there and where ultimately we could end up going.
Pat Ahern:
 Yeah. So, what I think you anchored on the right the right point. I think the piece that we have that has the most predictable impact on our on our margin strength is the asset side. And we've set the table and are getting the growth in the asset classes where we made the investment, the C&I book, and then stopped adding or let the old third-party RESI roll off. It really is grinding up asset yields in a sustainable way even if rates come down a few clicks. So what and so that we feel really good about that. We think we've demonstrated that consistently it came through again this quarter.
So and it also that also gave us confidence to raise the guidance, both the growth and where we finished the quarter. Though, I think probably the most uncertainty there's the same opportunity of remixing our deposits going forward. But it'll be unclear on how big that opportunity is. It'll be dependent on where the market takes deposit rates. So most of our guidance is again maintaining the margin that we've established and then growing our NII through growing the balance sheet. Rather than making a bet on interest rates.
Scott Siefert:
 Got it.
Derek Meyer:
 Okay. Thank you. And then maybe if you can actually expand on something to what you alluded toward the end of that response, but sort of the deposit pricing side, maybe any update on kind of strategies there I guess the background of the question is I know, like, there are the seasonal nuances balances, and then I think there are some kinda higher cost roll offs. But just the sequential downdraft in downdraft in, interest bearing deposit costs, it was you know, much larger than most that we're seeing this quarter, meaning good things. So, just curious you know, how is how are overall how's the overall strategy looking? What would be the outlook going forward?
That sort of best guess.
Andy Harmening:
 I'm gonna take this is Andy. I'm gonna take that one. First, I'd say the discipline we have around pricing is significant. Whether that is with the entire back book of the portfolio or becoming due nature of the CD book. The retention of our CDs and the strategy around that, we're hovering around 84 or 85%. Retention and getting pricing that's been good. And helped to become creative. The thing I'm pretty pleased within the second quarter, even though we had the seasonal decrease that we expected, the ability to manage the interest bearing aspect of that during that time and still expand margin was really was really strong on our part.
So when we look at the rest of the year, we have we have the same discipline and approach in forecast out of each one of those buckets and categories what we expect then is with both the seasonal flow and the increase in kind of BAU, We forecast our we forecast our NII based on being relatively flat in NIM. So if deposit pricing doesn't become irrational, we think there could be some positive upside, but we don't wanna bet on that just yet.
Scott Siefert:
 Got it.
Derek Meyer:
 Alright. Perfect. Thank you both very much.
Derek Meyer:
 Thank you. You're welcome.
Operator:
 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McElroy with Stephens. Please proceed.
Terry McElroy:
 Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Andy Harmening:
 Hey Terry. I guess I'll just start with a question based
Terry McElroy:
 on this afternoon's news, kind of your updated thoughts on acquisitions, your capital is growing, your stocks outperformed, your business models generating performance above expectations. So I'd love to get your updated thoughts on M and A.
Andy Harmening:
 I liked all those things you said, Terry. In fact, if you repeated that question, I could hear it over and over. I'd say a couple of things. One, sorry, thanks. Look, if something came to us, it would have to be a really good fit. Strategically, it'd have to be a good fit financially. It'd have to be a good fit culturally. The things that we wanted to achieve with our strap plan. We're remember, we're only a year and a half into it and we're just starting to harvest the profitability of that. We're seeing margin expansion. We're seeing household growth. We're seeing a ROTCE increase. We're seeing customer satisfaction. At a historical highs and strong revenue growth.
So I've said this a lot of times, that is that is our number one priority. It's our first priority. If you do that well enough, you lead you lead yourself to opportunities. But I would just reiterate, it would have to be a good fit kind of all the ways that we think about, otherwise. And our team's very much locked in into delivering the forecasting guidance that we've provided for 2025 right now.
Terry McElroy:
 Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, when I look at the ACL for the C and I portfolio, it was 136, it's gone up to 150. And I'm assuming it's just not a riskier portfolio of loans today versus a year ago in terms of the growth that we've had. So we just hopefully you could provide some color into why that specific ACL is gone up where others have been flat to maybe down in some cases.
Pat Ahern:
 You've largely hit on it. It's a growth story there. So we're certainly going to have movement within the risk ratings that will affect it from quarter to quarter. But overall, it's been a growth story. You know, our spot balances, CRE investor was down. This quarter, so there was there'd be a release there. Then for comparison's sake on the CRE construction, we're gonna be we have a little more aggressive build on those when we fund deals. We're gonna you know, appropriately grab that risk upfront when we close new deals. So you'll see when you have growth, you'll see that ACL rate go up.
Terry McElroy:
 Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.
Pat Ahern:
 Thanks, sir.
Terry McElroy:
 Our next question comes from the line of Chris Christopher McGratty with KBW.
Operator:
 Please proceed.
Chris Christopher McGratty:
 Hey, good afternoon. This is Chris O'Connell filling in for Chris. I just I make it. Yeah. Exactly. I just wanted to start off thinking about the positive operating leverage that you guys have been able to put up over the first half of this year? And as you get further along to 2026, if you view that as continuing and still sustainable?
Andy Harmening:
 The short answer is yes. That is the goal going to every single year. The little bit expanded answer of that is kind of in the details of where we are on the strat plan. And what I'd say is when you think about the number of RMs that we've hired and the increase that we have relationship managers in commercial, when I look at the pipeline that we're increasing and when I when I what we have to believe is that resi is gonna slowly decrease It is. Have to believe that commercial loan growth is going to increase. It is, and it's increasing at an increasing rate.
We have to believe that we're going to add because that means that you start to bring in lower cost granular deposits we are. And you have to have discipline around the pricing of what you're doing on the back book as well. And so we feel like when we do that and we've gone into every budget season, basically, with the requirement request from our leadership team that they bring ideas on expense saves. Before we talk about where we're going to spend money so that we kinda mitigate the risk there.
So with all the pieces that we're talking about, right now, it sure looks like we're gonna be able to continue on with the with the positive operating, leverage, throughout this year and into 2026. Great. And then, you know, on you know, the hiring, you know, efforts here, You know, how does the pipeline look for hiring throughout the rest of the year? And then I think you guys had talked about sitting down post the end of the Phase two investments.
Chris Christopher McGratty:
 Kind of mapping out some of the next steps? Any preview into you know, the forward investments that are being contemplated going forward? 
Andy Harmening:
 Two really good questions. We are in a really I was reflecting on this just earlier today with our commercial banking. You know, three or four years ago, we were working really hard on the recruiting. Two years ago, we ramped that up again. In the last six to twelve months, we're getting inbound calls from people, and that's that's really makes it a lot better and word-of-mouth is spread. We've completed our hiring. You've never fully complete if there's somebody that's exceptional in a market. But our ability to get talent, has increased, improved over the last four years, three years, two years, and even in the last year.
What's interesting on that is the predominance of our production is still coming from people that we hire pre-2023. That's going to shift as we head into the end of this year and the beginning of next year as non solicitations expire. So we have a lot of legs still in what the hiring piece has been. But so I think it's 64% is from the legacy. Even the people hired in '24 have the next biggest piece of about 23%. So we only have about 10 to 15% of our production from those we've hired in '20 in 2025. So pretty optimistic there.
There is room to add in some key markets should that come available, but we're gonna be very kind of selective in what potential expansion is. There is never a shortage of ideas. What we'll do is we'll take that and we'll talk about what do we most swiftly, what fits our risk profile, what has the fastest payback. That's the process that we'll go through in the second half of this year. I don't feel a lot of pressure to add new initiatives immediately because throughout '26, we'll harvest the ones we have. But right now, we'll talk about that.
We're likely at a couple, and then and then see how we layer that in as we head into the '20 going into '27. We're in a good position where we can look twelve to twenty four months out and see what revenue forecast might be and then add to that in a very specific way.
Chris Christopher McGratty:
 Great. Thank you. And last one for me, given those comments and kind of the harvesting in the pipeline that you guys have, over the next year and a half here. You know, any update, I guess, on timing or the glide path
Andy Harmening:
 towards the mid teen medium term ROTC target. That something that given this momentum you think you'll be seeing in 2026? Chris, if I were asking that question, I would have first said great job on hitting the NIM target of three plus percent. I would have said way to go on the net charge offs being on track at less than 35 basis points. And you guys said you'd be in an efficiency ratio of 55 to 60. I see you hit it early. I'm gonna get to that fourth one, and that's ROTC. And, you know, we saw a pretty nice expansion in the last ninety days.
We think as you continue to re we believe in our strategy. We believe this remix is going to matter. We think the increase in granular deposits is going to matter. We think that's gonna drive NIM, which almost everyone has told us improve your NIM. We're improving our NIM. So as that happens, we believe that puts us over the next the next twelve, twenty four months in a position to, to reach that target as well.
Pat Ahern:
 Great.
Chris Christopher McGratty:
 I appreciate it.
