Steve Lisi:
 Thanks, Corey. Good afternoon to everyone. With me here today is Doug Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll be brief today given the update just seven weeks ago on our fiscal earnings call. We continue to drive strong market adoption of LungFit PH, which was reflected in our financial results for the first fiscal quarter, including a 157% increase in revenue to $1.8 million compared with $700,000 for the same period last year. On a sequential basis, we reported a 50% increase over the quarter ended March 31, 2025. As a reminder, it was only a year ago that we implemented broad changes to our sales team and strategy under the leadership of the new chief commercial officer, David Webster.
This strategy included building out a distribution network in the United States and internationally, focusing more heavily on fostering customer relationships. While we quickly reported seeing positive market reactions to the new strategy and team, and our backlog of agreements started to build, it's only been over the course of the last two quarters that the financial performance of the company has really caught up. That said, our sales pipeline continues to build, and the more customers use LungFit PH, the more confidence grows in the product and our ability to provide top-tier service.
The key takeaway here is that we are now well-positioned to overcome the barriers to entry in the nitric oxide market with LungFit PH and are well on our way to becoming the market leader with the addition of LungFit PH2 in calendar year 2026, pending regulatory clearance. Considering the strong momentum in our business, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of $12 million to $16 million for fiscal year 2026. I will dig a little deeper into specific drivers behind our finance performance in 2026 and for the future. We continue to generate a steady flow of new hospital contracts in the US with two new hospital starts and contract renewals with three hospitals.
Some other important points I would like to put out there: One, more than 55% of our contracts are multiyear contracts. Two, this was the first quarter of international revenues being recorded. This comes after a tremendous amount of time spent working with our partners around the world, which we have documented on previous calls and in press releases. To put our current reach into perspective, we now have access to over 30 countries distribution partners covering more than 2 billion lives. We expect growth each quarter going forward with momentum picking up substantially in fiscal 2027. Turning back to the US, one of the market barriers we have focused on overcoming are the hospital networks and national purchasing groups.
We've just been added to the Premier network, which gives us two of the big three as we were added to Izian two years ago. Combined, these two GPOs provide us with access to close to 3,000 hospitals. We still have to be highly selective in our targeting until we have the second generation LungFit system, which is smaller, lighter, and designed for air and ground transportation while still delivering all the revolutionary features of the first generation machine. We believe that this system will offer capabilities that will allow us to penetrate larger hospitals and larger hospital systems.
Overall, we anticipate FDA approval of the second generation system and subsequent introduction to the US market will have a major impact on our market share, total annual volume, and logistics within the hospital. In regard to the Premier contract, we were awarded a national group purchasing agreement for therapeutic gases. This new agreement allows Premier members, at their discretion, to take advantage of special pricing in terms pre-negotiated by Premier for the LungFit PH system and disposable NO2 smart filters. This is a significant network for us to be aligned with. We believe it will open a lot of doors for our sales team.
Having this purchasing agreement will help streamline the sales process for Premier Hospital Network members as they contemplate converting their NO supply to LungFit PH. Turning to Beyond Cancer, we are assessing the best path forward for the program at this time. Phase 1b combination study with anti-PD-1 therapy is the target, and we will communicate more details once we secure a clinical trial assay. With respect to Neuronos, our subsidiary focused on therapy for autism spectrum disorders, I have no further update from the last time we spoke. As a reminder, Neuronox will meet with FDA later this year regarding its path to human studies, which we expect to begin by the end of calendar 2026.
Our LungFitGo program is still on track for a pre-IDE submission to FDA prior to year-end to discuss the clinical path forward. We continue to be encouraged by the progress across our business. LungFit PH is quickly gaining attention in hospitals across the US and now the world. We look forward to continuing to take market share and build awareness for our system throughout the remainder of fiscal 2026. And looking at fiscal 2027, we see the introduction of LungFit PH2 putting us on a path to take the majority of market share over time in what we believe could ultimately be a $1 billion global NO market. Now I will turn it over to our CFO, Doug Larson.
Doug Larson:
 Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for 2026, which ended June 30, 2025, are as follows. Revenue for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, increased 157% to $1.8 million compared with $700,000 for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024. We are showing a gross profit increase of approximately $500,000 to $200,000 for 2026 compared to a loss of $300,000 for the same period last year. The gross profit increase was due to increasing revenues, partially offset by depreciation of additional 2025. We reduced total operating expenses to just above $7.5 million in June from $13 million for the same period last year.
This translates to a 40% reduction year over year and greater than 55% reduction from a high of $17 million at its peak. We believe a trough in our operating expenses will be in the current quarter which ends September 30, 2025. Please do not interpret that expenses will be moving up significantly in December. We anticipate expenses will move up in proportion to our commercial performance to maintain our excellence in service and take advantage of coming opportunities. Research and development expenses were $3.1 million for the fiscal quarter in 2026 as compared with $6 million for the same period last year.
The decrease of $2.9 million was across the board, with decreases in salaries, stock-based compensation costs, clinical and preclinical expenses, professional fees, and Gen 2 device development costs. SG&A expense for the quarters ended June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, were $4.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The decrease of $2.5 million was attributed primarily to the reduction in salaries, stock-based compensation costs, marketing, advertising, and legal fees. Other expense was $500,000 compared with a $500,000 income for the same period a year ago. The increase in expense of $1 million was mainly due to a prior period gain associated with the change in fair value of the derivative liability for $1 million.
Net loss attributed to the common stockholders of Beyond Air Inc was $7.7 million or a loss of $1.53 per share basic and diluted. Our net loss for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, was $12.2 million or a loss of $5.32 per share basic and diluted. Please note that the per share results were calculated to reflect the company's one-for-20 reverse stock split which became effective on July 14, 2025. As a reminder, we implemented this reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rule 5550(a)(2). I am pleased to announce that Nasdaq has since notified the company that we are now back in compliance with all listing rules.
Net cash burn for the quarter was $4.7 million which is more than 60% lower than the first quarter of last fiscal year. This decrease reflects our reduction in operating expenses, including wrapping up spending on the development of our next-generation LungFit device in June. We've reported a strong reduction in our cash burn in Q1 and expect to see continued drop again in Q2. As of June 30, 2025, we reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $6.5 million.
We believe that our cash and existing financing vehicles will be sufficient to allow us to support current operating plans well into calendar 2026 and potentially to profitability, provided we continue to hit our internal revenue estimates and control costs at Beyond Air. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Steve.
Steve Lisi:
 Thanks, Doug. We'll now take some questions. Thank you.
Operator:
 Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone keypad. You may press star and 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Ladies and gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while we poll for questions.
Marie Thibault:
 The first question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG. Please go ahead. Hi. Good evening, and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question here. I know you're confident in your guidance range for the year, and you had some very nice 50% sequential growth this quarter. So really great to see it. How should we think about, you know, the various growth drivers coming together this year, Steve? I'm thinking about existing contracts, things like the Premier Agreement. Is this all sort of coming together now? Or do we need to see new sources of growth, more acceleration in order for you to kind of hit that range?
How are you thinking about it?
Steve Lisi:
 Oh, thanks, Marie. Look. You know, we certainly need a little bit more, you know, throughout the next, you know, seven months of the fiscal year. So yeah, we don't have the range set by what was in our pocket today. That's by design, obviously. I mean, we have a lot of open opportunities that are in front of us. That we expect to win a certain percentage of those and hit our numbers. We feel very confident about that. So Premier is a big piece of that. I don't think that Premier coming on in July is gonna have a major impact on this fiscal year. It does take time.
You know, we've said in the past about four to twelve months from the first contact with the hospital, and now with Premier, we're able to have these conversations with their members. Prior to this, we may have had conversations, but, really, they were just introductory. There really weren't much serious discussions until we got on with Premier. So those discussions are happening now. So we think there could be some impact in this fiscal year. Obviously, it'll be a much bigger impact next fiscal year. So what we have in hand is very strong and we're very confident that we'll hit the range.
But you know, I think it's unfair to say that Doug and I are sitting here with 12 to 16 in our pocket if nothing else happened from today. That's just not the truth. I don't think it needs to be the truth, Marie. I mean, we have a lot of time before the end of the fiscal.
Marie Thibault:
 Sure. Sure. Makes sense. Okay. But you feel good with being on track here. Okay. And then I guess I would ask a little bit about OUS. You called out some acceleration, I think, in the press release. And I know through your partners, you have exposure to several countries. Are there certain countries we should be listing for? Are there opportunities for big tenders here over the coming quarters? Just a I wanna get a little smarter on the OUS.
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah. I think, you know, as you mentioned, the tenders, they do take a little bit of time. So you know, signing up a distributor or distribution partner in a country doesn't mean sales are coming the next day. Right? It does take some time. So the initial sales to our distribution partners are through, you know, demonstration devices and training devices that they have for themselves. And then, you know, a few quarters after that, you'll start to get, you know, some victories with hospitals, tenders. However they do it in each country will be different. So I think that we would anticipate some of these wins on hospitals coming, you know, towards the end of this fiscal year.
You know, getting hospitals signed up in June or getting partners, excuse me, signed up in June would put us a couple of quarters later before we start winning hospitals. It does take time. We've got to get, you know, devices shipped. We've got to get everybody trained. We've got to get marketing materials in their hands. So it does take a couple of quarters. So I think that we'll start to see the benefits of what we've put in place as we get towards the end of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year. But the revenues you're seeing now are from us selling to our partners what they need for training and demonstration purposes in their countries.
Marie Thibault:
 Understood. Thanks for the thoughts, Steve.
Steve Lisi:
 Thanks, Marie.
Operator:
 Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jason Vitesse from Roth Capital Partners.
Jason Vitesse:
 Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and a solid quarter. Just first off, can you now that you've kind of revamped the sales effort, with a new COO, can you give us a sense of kind of how long it's taking to go from initial contact with the customer to, you know, finally closing a deal and sending off the machines?
Steve Lisi:
 Sure. Yeah. I mean, it's anywhere from four to twelve months. It does take time from the initial contact. So some are quicker than others, and some have, you know, long process where, you know, they're taking bids from multiple companies, kinda like a tender overseas, a little different here. But those things do exist. So it does take time.
Jason Vitesse:
 And I mean, I take it you can tell who's gonna take twelve months and who's gonna take four months depending on the hospital system. Generally, in terms of just your forecasting.
Steve Lisi:
 Usually, we have a pretty good guess. Yeah.
Jason Vitesse:
 Okay. Sorry. But just wanted to clarify that.
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah.
Jason Vitesse:
 Secondly, if you could help us out on you mentioned that SG&A OpEx expenses are basically gonna grow with revenue. Any sense how we should model that? Does that mean, I mean, from a is that from a percentage basis, a quarterly basis, or maybe just a little more detail on how we should be thinking about the progression for the rest of the year. Assuming, you know, we're all gonna be modeling kind of within the guidance range you provided?
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah. I think that, you know, like Doug mentioned, you'll see September, you know, tick down from the June quarter. Right now, the December quarter, you know, it might be roughly around the September quarter for expenses, give or take. And, you know, as we start to see the growth, you know, there might be, you know, for example, as we get higher sales, you know, there are certain people and certain things we pay commission on. So you'll see expenses tick up, and I don't think any of our cost-cutting will offset that as we get towards the end of this fiscal year. So you will see some movement.
That's why December is kinda shaky on whether it's gonna be higher or right around September. But in the March quarter, last quarter of our fiscal year, you will see expenses moving up commensurate with the increase in revenues.
Jason Vitesse:
 Got it. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks for the detail.
Steve Lisi:
 Thanks.
Operator:
 Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Justin Walsh from Jones Trading. Please go ahead.
Justin Walsh:
 Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You alluded to this, but I was wondering if you could comment on how your engagement efforts are being facilitated by your Premier agreement. Just wondering how much of it is a question of getting your foot in the door, raising awareness, and removing friction for these hospitals.
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah. I mean, I think just being on with Premier, it removes, you know, the big initial barrier. It's gone. Now we can have free discussions with them, and, you know, one of the nice things about the GPOs is, you know, you set your pricing in the contract with them. So have something to work off of right away. So it does save a little bit of time. So yeah, I mean, this is a big barrier removed without being on Premier.
Justin Walsh:
 Very extremely difficult to contract with a Premier hospital.
Steve Lisi:
 Great. Thanks for taking the question.
Operator:
 Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Yale Jen from Laidlaw and Company.
Yale Jen:
 Good afternoon, Steve, and congrats on the quarter. My first question is that last time in the middle of the quarter, you gave some guidance in terms of the top line. I just wonder whether this time you have any insights or look or can you review anything about all the sales so far in this quarter? And I have a follow-up.
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah. So, yeah, last when we reported our fiscal year earnings, I mean, and there was, like, ten days, twelve days left in the quarter. So it wasn't a stretch for us to preannounce that quarter. Now we're not even halfway through the quarter. So I'm not gonna be commenting on quarterly estimates for, again, at our fiscal year, which will be next June. So we reiterated our fiscal year guidance, and that should show our confidence.
Yale Jen:
 Sure. I agree. And that looks good. And you have any could you give some guidance in terms of how many hospitals at this time already installed the LungFit PH?
Steve Lisi:
 I think we've given that exact number, but it's getting to be a pretty big number. I mean, I guess we could say dozens and dozens of hospitals. So that would be good. I think that's about all I'll there. Yeah. But we're certainly growing the hospitals. There are a lot of them using LungFit PH, and the more that do, the more references we get and the more comfort people have with us as a company servicing them. So it's certainly moving in the right direction.
Yale Jen:
 Can I just squeeze one more here? In terms of the two PMA filing, I know you hate to give guidance, because that has sort of unpredictable, but nevertheless, just curious. What's your current sort of expectation, but for the cardiac surgery as well as for the second gen. And thanks.
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah. So I'm definitely not gonna give timing on this. We're not gonna guess what FDA is going to do, but I will say that our focus is on the second generation machine. And as a smaller company, you know, we wanna keep FDA focused on what's important to us. And right now, the second generation machine is more important to us than the cardiac indication. I think the cardiac indication loses a little bit of its luster with the second generation machine in terms of the impact it will have. So right now, our focus with our team and with FDA, talking to them, is on Gen 2.
Yale Jen:
 Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Again, congrats, and appreciate the confidence. So for the guidance.
Steve Lisi:
 Thanks, Yale.
Operator:
 Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Jason Bednar:
 Hey. Good afternoon. Steve, I wanted to start really to try to follow-up on a few questions already. I think a lot of us are really trying to dial in on the guide just in the context of how the year started. The nature of the business here requires these contracts to steadily build throughout the year. And really tap into that nice razor blade model you have. It seems like you need sequential revenue to grow at a 50% quarter over quarter pace the next few quarters to finish near the midpoint that reaffirmed guide today. I guess beyond that internal confidence you're speaking to, anything more tangible you can give us? I know Marie was asking some questions.
There've been some others here. Just, you know, anything beyond just, like, you know, we're confident we can do this that you can help us bridge that gap on, you know, getting to that 50% quarter over quarter growth that, you know, we need to see in the business?
Steve Lisi:
 Yeah. I'll do my best. So you know, we're now partnered in over 30 countries outside the United States. So all of these partners are going to be working with us, and we'll be training them, and we have training sessions in Europe and in the US, so we're moving quickly with our partners. So we anticipate that, you know, the revenues from ex-US just to get our partners up and running is going to be strong throughout the rest of this fiscal year. So that we have a lot of confidence in, and we will be signing more partners before the end of this fiscal year. So there's a lot of confidence on the international side from that perspective.
And, again, Marie asked about tenders and winning hospitals there. We have very limited amounts of wins in our guidance. So if we do get some wins, and I can say that there are some of the partners out there that have already put their hat in the ring for some tenders. It's early days, but they have. In a few countries, so we'll see. So there's definitely some cushion there if we start winning tenders earlier than we expect to. And it's definitely possible, but we're not counting on it. Right? This is early days on the international side, so we don't want any large assumptions, and we haven't in our guidance. Okay? So that's the international side.
On the domestic side, you know, we've been at this now for close to three years. We had to change our commercial team. Our chief commercial officer has been here now. It's thirteen months. He's put a lot of things in place. And I think we've already announced a lot of these things. Right? We talked about our partnership with Trilamed. They're gonna help us with the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration. We did partner with Guam, you know, at the beginning of this year. Or end of last year. And that was just the beginning. You know, this was something that was a need, and we stepped up and took care of it.
So I think that, you know, the rest of the hospitals and Department of Defense and Veterans Administration are probably gonna follow what the normal rules are, and it took takes time to get on. Like we got on Premier and Visient. It takes time to get on with the Veterans Administration, DOD. So we expect that to occur at some point in this fiscal year and contribute, you know, with Premier, we'll have more hospitals. I think we'll get some there. We've been talking to some before this happened. So I think there'll be some follow-through there before the end of the fiscal year.
You know, David, our new chief commercial ops, has done a very good job with Visient and kind of, you know, refocusing our efforts and working with the Visient team so we have a better relationship there. So we see momentum. We see what's in the pipeline, you know, for us. So we're already, you know, have this vision of what's staring us in the face for the next six months. And our machine is performing extremely well. You know, when you look back two years ago, we were still waiting for software updates from the FDA. So our, you know, incarnation of Gen 1 at its peak really started in May. So people are getting comfortable with it.
You know? We've signed first luminary site in Vanderbilt. They've been very helpful. So I think that there's a lot of momentum for us in the US and internationally we can get this done. I'm doing my best here. I don't want to give too much information. You know, everyone's listening. We have competitors. So I'd like to keep it to what I've said. I hope that satisfies your question.
Jason Bednar:
 Yeah. Yeah. If I could follow-up maybe to tease it out just a bit more and feel free to share what you're comfortable with. On the can you talk about, you know, the attribution you'd give to international out of that $12 to $16 million, and if you're comfortable, the pace of maybe when you think that some of that might layer in throughout the course of fiscal 2026. And then point two, you know, you didn't mention it. I don't know if it's possible that you had visibility on contract renewals. You referenced some in your prepared remarks for the first quarter. Are economics there superior to what they were previously? Is that contributing?
Where are you these are expanded relationships or just better economics for Beyond Air? That are also, like, you know, embedded in that $12 to $16 million outlook.
Steve Lisi:
 So in the outlook, we don't count on contracts being renewed above where they were before. We don't count on renegotiated contracts. It does happen. I would say that some of our renewals, you know, the hospitals use more than they thought in their first year, and, you know, we will, you know, recontract with them or renew them at higher rates, you know, higher amounts of hours so it is more money. So we don't have that in our forecasts. We don't count on that.
And Doug's looking at me, you know, like, you know, we definitely have a couple of our customers that are asking us to give them longer-term contracts because they're using too much and, you know, they want to make sure that they have certainty of payments. Right? So they want to pay the same price every month and they get to month eight or nine, and they've used up all the hours that they're supposed to have. So we will work with them and try to come up with a way to make it easier on them. But again, we're not we don't have penalties. We don't have extra costs at the end of a contract.
They just kind of keep paying at this roughly the same hourly rate that they were paying at for their year. They just have to keep paying that rate if they're using more hours. And sometimes for hospitals, it's difficult because they want to just keep the same payment every month. So we do have this happen every month or two. There's somebody asking us this question. And we work with them, and we come up with ways to make it work for them and work for us. So, yeah, that can help us from a fiscal year standpoint. But it's not something that Doug and I have really dialed into the model because it's unpredictable.
But we certainly have some hospitals that will help us from that front.
