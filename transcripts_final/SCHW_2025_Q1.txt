Meanwhile, we remain firmly committed to advancing the strategic initiative of Chinese Experience 2,000 Premier hotels, which not only strengthens our brand awareness and product offerings, but also drives the transformation and elevation of the industry's value chain. Next, I would like to provide more details on our business performance for the first quarter of 2025. Let's begin with our hotel business. Please turn to Slide 4 of our 1Q ' 25 results presentation.

We carefully screen and evaluate both new hotel signings and openings to ensure sustainable high-quality growth. Next, I would like to share the latest developments for Atour's hotel brands. In the first quarter, guided by our long-term growth philosophy and deep insight into current business travel trends, we implemented upgrades to our mid-scale and upper mid-scale hotel products. Please turn to Slide 7.
In the upper mid-scale segment, we launched Atour 3.6 in the first quarter. This product embodies an in-harmony with nature design philosophy, seamlessly integrating business functionality and a relaxed ambience. Furthermore, Atour 3.6 prioritizes enhanced convenience and comfort through optimized space utilization and upgraded functional design. This innovation enables us to deliver a comprehensive full scenario ultimate business travel experience, setting a new benchmark for premium business travel in the upper mid-scale market. Since its launch, Atour 3.6 has received a widespread market recognition and a positive feedback from franchisees through its strong product vitality, holistically upgraded our customer experience features and efficient investment returns. We believe this product will further solidify our core competitiveness in the upper mid-scale segment.
Please turn to Slide 8.

Together, Series 3 and Series 4 product lines address diverse customer aesthetic preferences and accommodation needs while also providing franchisees with a broader range of investment options.

By continuously enhancing our product competitiveness with reinforced experience differentiations, we effectively meet the diverse needs of broader demographics, further solidifying our leadership across market segments.
Now moving to our retail business. Please turn to Slide 10.

Online channels continued to contribute over 90% of total GMV. Please turn to Slide 11. Since its inception, Atour Planet has remained committed to studying and integrating customers' sleep needs across both hotel and home environments. This anchors the deep sleep experience firmly in the minds of customers.
Across different scenarios, Atour Planet's products not only fulfill customers' functional needs, but also deeply resonate with their emotional needs. In the pillow category, our deep sleep memory foam Pillow Pro series maintained robust sales performance in the first quarter, consistently ranking as the top seller in its category on major third-party e-commerce platforms. Since its launch, the accumulated sales of the deep sleep memory foam Pillow Pro series have exceeded 6 million units, further solidifying Atour Planet's leading position in the pillow category. Please turn to Slide 12. Based on our capture and exploration of user needs as well as the refinement and analysis of user feedback, Atour Planet has developed a standardized user-driven product iteration model.
In March, in line with seasonal changes, we launched the Deep Sleep Thermal regulating Comforter Pro 2.0 summer season, serving as the upgraded version of the Deep Sleep lightweight Comforter introduced last year, this new product further optimizes the breathable cooling system, aiming to provide the customers with a natural and cozy coolness instead of an ultimate coat touch. Upon launch, the product received a widespread consumer praise, ranking first in sales in its category on Tmall and Douyin in its first month.

We continue to enhance our A-Card membership ecosystem by gaining deeper insights into user behavior and preferences across different business formats.
This enables us to further integrate hotel and retail businesses, thereby driving cross consumption between them. In the first quarter, alongside the launch of new retail products, we introduced cross-promotional campaigns that allow retail customers to access our hotel membership benefits. These initiatives have attracted more retail customers to our hotels, driving further conversions across our business segments. In terms of member engagement, we actively leverage emerging trends in leisure and business travel to continuously deliver experiences and benefits that highly resonate with customers. For example, during the spring festival, we launched our countertrend travel blind hotel booking campaign, catering to the younger travelers growing preference for exploring niche crowd-free destinations.
We also introduced the destination ambassadors to share local travel inspiration. Additionally, we partnered with a vertical travel platform to establish integrated memberships, further embedding our value proposition throughout customers' journey and enhancing member loyalty. Finally, I am pleased to announce the recent release of our 2024 ESG report. Please turn to Slide 15. Throughout 2024, we continued to strengthen our ESG governance by embedding sustainability principles across both hotel and retail businesses. At the same time, we are actively fulfilling our social responsibilities through industrial support and social assistance programs in Yaduo Village.

Operator:
 
[Operator Instructions]
 Our first question comes from Sijie Lin from CICC.
Sijie Lin:
 [Interpreted] Could you please share the performance of RevPAR since Q2 and provide outlook on RevPAR for the full year?
Haijun Wang:
 [Interpreted] In Q1, the overall market experienced some volatility. There were multiple factors to be considered, including weather conditions, macroeconomic impacts, they're all affecting travel demand. Our RevPAR decreased by 7.2% year-over-year and also OCC and ADR were showing varying degrees of decline year-over-year as well. Entering Q2, we observed a continued divergence in market demand. While there were the recovery of business travel, but it remains quite uncertain to some extent, leisure travel demand has demonstrated some notable resilience. During the Labor Day holiday, both pricing and occupancy performed quite strongly, exceeding prior year levels. So overall, we anticipate there might be some easing of RevPAR pressure in Q2 when compared to Q1.
And as for our view on the full year RevPAR performance, it is still remaining consistent with the beginning of the year. And RevPAR still faces considerable uncertainty given the ongoing market volatility. However, in terms of our operations, we will not just blindly engage in price competitions with the homogenized products in the market. What we will do is to continue to adhere to Atour's differentiated experience advantages to seize the core revenue opportunities, and we are going to adopt a more balanced and refined revenue management strategy in terms of both ADR and OCC so that we can continuously build the long-term brand value of Atour.
Operator:
 Next, we have Ronald Leung from Bank of America.
Ronald Leung:
 [Interpreted] Could you please share your view on the new signings momentum and also new hotel openings for the full year of 2025?
Haijun Wang:
 [Interpreted] Thank you, Ronald. Let me answer your question. In the first quarter, we remained positive signing momentum amid industry-wide pressure from homogeneous supply Atour, we solidified our unique market positioning through our differentiated brand strategy and distinctive experiential strength. This has continuously drawn the attention of high-quality franchisees. In addition, against the backdrop of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, we have clearly observed along the way that compared to other investment channels, the hotel industry offers still a relatively stable cash flow returns and a more robust business model. So despite some RevPAR volatility, the premium property rental cost still is remaining in a relatively low range with improved availability, and that makes the overall returns attractive in the long term.
As a result to that, mature hotel franchisees are still remaining confident and are willing to seize opportunities to capture that long-term growth potential of premium brands in the future market. As for new openings, in the first quarter of this year, we opened 121 hotels, continuing that high-quality expansion trend since we had last year. Based upon that, we maintain our full year opening guidance of 500 new openings and have full confidence in achieving this goal, steadily advancing toward our strategic objective of reaching 2,000 premier hotels by the year-end.
Also based on our strategic goal of 2,000 premier hotels, we will impose stricter requirements on quality from multiple dimensions, including signings, openings and operation to ensure that our hotel numbers grow with quality so that every hotel can provide users with a consistently high-quality experience. Thank you.
Operator:
 Next, we have Dan Chee from Morgan Stanley.
Dan Chee:
 [Interpreted] My question is related to the company's retail business. We saw retail business revenue growth in the first quarter was outstanding at 67% year-on-year. Previously, the company guided full year retail revenue of no less than 35% growth. I would like to ask the management about any update to the full year revenue guidance on this business and any strategic plan for retail in the coming period? Thank you.
Haijun Wang:
 [Interpreted] Thank you, Dan. In first quarter, we seized the key marketing opportunities of the Spring Festival. Also, we gained advantage from that continuous popularity of the Deep Sleep series products. Our retail business achieved a year-on-year growth of over 70% in GMV. Meanwhile, we can see that the sales trend of the new products we launched in March, namely the Deep Sleep Thermal regulating Comfort Pro 2.0 summer season is also very strong. Looking at the full year, though the market competition is still remaining intense.
However, because of our continuous enhancement of Atour Planet product offerings as well as the brand awareness, we are quite confident in the performance of our upcoming product launches, also the major promotional campaigns we have in our plans. Based upon this outlook, we are now raising our full year retail revenue growth forecast to 50% year-over-year. Meanwhile, despite there are still some RevPAR uncertainties, the strong performance of our retail business led us to increase our group's full year revenue growth guidance to the range of in between 25% to 30% year-over-year.
In the future, Atour Planet will continue to focus on the deep sleep domain, enhance product R&D, improve our product quality, also consolidate our moat in supply chain to achieve higher quality and sustainable development of both the products and our brand. Thank you.
Operator:
 Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Wei Liu from Citics.
Wei Liu:
 [Interpreted] We noticed that you had just announced dividend and share buyback program. Could you share some thoughts of the overall considerations behind these initiatives?
Haijun Wang:
 [Interpreted] Thank you, Wei. Well, like we said before, we remain committed to creating long-term value and rewarding our shareholders' trust and support through concrete actions. So in addition to the dividend, we have also officially announced today a 3-year share repurchase program with a total amount not exceeding USD 400 million. Regarding the dividend, we will continue implementing the 3-year dividend plan established last year, under which the annual cumulative dividend payout will be no less than 50% of the net income in the previous fiscal year. That's why this year, as we announced, our first dividend distribution totals approximately USD 58 million, representing about 1/3, 33% of the prior fiscal year's net income.
And moving forward into the future, we will implement a comprehensive shareholder return program by combining dividend payout and share buyback together. While ensuring the company's stable and normal capital operations, we will actively consider various shareholder return methods in line with actual business conditions to enhance shareholder yield and enable all shareholders to share in the company's growth achievements.

Lydia Ling:
 [Interpreted] Could you provide an update on the progression of your upscale of brands? And also, we noticed the launch of some new products across both the upper scale and also mid-scale brands. So could you elaborate more on the strategies for them?
Haijun Wang:
 [Interpreted] Thank you, Lydia. In terms of our upscale brands, I'd like to talk about our new brand [indiscernible] Hotel. We consistently adhere to a quality-first principle. And our goal is to develop a batch of flagship projects. We are pleased to take this opportunity to announce that within this month, our [indiscernible] flagship hotel at Binhu of Shenzhen will officially commence operations on the 28th of May. So since the trial operations of 2 Sahu Hotel, which started this year, their product positioning, design, aesthetics and service experiences have received widespread acclaim from the consumers.
And we have the confidence that [indiscernible] Hotel's core concept of Chinese experience and its brand ethos Oriental Serenity will establish new benchmarks in the upperscale hotel market in China. And in the upper mid-scale hotel segment, as I mentioned earlier, our Atour 3 and Atour 4 series will coexist, and they will jointly shape our next-generation upper mid-scale hotel portfolio so that it not only reaches the choices of franchisees, but also meet the diverse accommodation needs of consumers, also to further expand the market coverage so as to consolidating Atour's leading position in the upper mid-scale market.
