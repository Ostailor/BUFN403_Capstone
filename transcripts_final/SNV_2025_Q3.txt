Greetings, and welcome to Synovus Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katharine C. Freeman, Director of Investor Relations.

Please go ahead.

Katharine C. Freeman
Thank you, and good morning. Synovus issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website at investor.synovus.com. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Our actual results may differ significantly from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and we caution investors not to place undue reliance on these statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding Synovus' business, the economy and other future conditions and are not guarantees of future performance. We also refer you to our recent filings with the SEC, all available at sec.gov, for additional information regarding risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This call references certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide useful information to evaluate company performance. Reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings press release and presentation, both available on our website. We will be discussing our current views and expectations around long-term trends in credit and macroeconomic assumptions.

These views are subject to change as economic and market conditions evolve. Joining me on today's call are Synovus Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Kevin Blair; and Chief Financial Officer, Jamie Gregory. Also available for Q&A are Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Sean Simpson; and Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Scott Howell.

Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin.

Kevin S. Blair
Thank you, Katherine. Q3 marks another quarter of consistent and disciplined execution across Synovus. We delivered solid financial performance, continued to improve our funding profile and maintained strong credit outcomes while supporting our clients and communities.

Revenue trends remained healthy with broad-based contribution across spread and fee income, while expense management continued to reflect focused prioritization and operating rigor. Loan growth was balanced and aligned to our risk appetite, and deposit performance remained constructive as we benefited from franchise strength and ongoing pricing discipline.

Importantly, credit quality metrics remained stable, and our capital position provides flexibility to support growth and shareholder return objectives. While the broader macro environment continues to evolve, our client base remains resilient and our teams are executing with urgency and accountability.

I'll now turn it over to Jamie for the financial details.

Jamie Gregory
Thanks, Kevin. For the quarter, we generated net income available to common shareholders of $167 million, or $1.18 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax pre-provision income improved linked quarter, reflecting margin expansion and durable fee generation.

Net interest income benefited from lower funding costs and favorable asset repricing dynamics. We continued to see improvement in total deposit costs, supported by mix and pricing actions. Loan balances were modestly higher, with growth concentrated in targeted commercial categories.

Non-interest income was supported by treasury and payment solutions, wealth management and capital markets-related activity. Expense trends were in line with expectations, and we continued to invest selectively in strategic initiatives while maintaining cost discipline.

Credit performance remained stable. Provision expense reflected portfolio trends and macro assumptions. Net charge-offs and criticized migration were manageable, and reserve levels remain appropriate.

Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.6%, which positions us well as we balance growth and capital return.

With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed.

Ebrahim Poonawala
Good morning. Maybe just starting on the margin outlook. NIM expanded nicely again this quarter. How should we think about sustainability from here, particularly as funding costs continue to adjust?

Jamie Gregory
Thanks, Ebrahim. We were pleased with margin performance this quarter. Going forward, we still see room for modest improvement driven primarily by deposit repricing and mix, though pace will likely moderate versus what we saw in recent quarters. Asset yields remain supportive, but we expect the bigger driver near-term to be continued funding optimization.

Ebrahim Poonawala
That's helpful. And just one on credit. Are there any segments where you're seeing incremental stress?

Sean Simpson
Nothing broad-based at this stage. We continue to monitor borrower-level trends in certain pockets, but overall migration and reserve performance remain within our expectations.

Operator
Our next question comes from Catherine Mealor with KBW.

Catherine Mealor
Good morning. Could you discuss your appetite for buybacks versus retaining excess capital for growth, particularly given your current CET1 position?

Kevin S. Blair
Our capital framework remains balanced. We want to preserve flexibility to support client growth and strategic investments, while also returning capital when valuation and market conditions make that compelling. So you'll continue to see a measured approach there.

Catherine Mealor
Great. And just a quick follow-up on expenses. Any notable puts and takes into year-end?

Jamie Gregory
The broad trajectory is unchanged. We'll continue to manage expenses tightly while investing in areas tied to client delivery, risk and long-term efficiency.

Operator
Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Blair for any closing comments.

Kevin S. Blair
Thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Synovus.

Operator
This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
