SUMMARY
The executive team highlighted the successful execution of strategic initiatives aimed at reducing asset sensitivity, which contributed to consistent net interest income growth across rate cycles. Loan growth was primarily concentrated in the CRE segment, with increased unfunded construction commitments, setting the stage for further expansion. Nonperforming assets increased modestly but were attributed to a small number of specific credits and addressed through targeted reserves and asset resolution plans. Management committed to disciplined expense management and expects continued revenue gains to support an improved efficiency ratio and steady returns. Capital levels rose quarter-over-quarter, enhancing the company’s flexibility for organic growth, acquisitions, and potential share repurchases as favorable opportunities arise.
Mark Kochvar said, "we see nothing in our credit risk rating stack, credit scoring, or delinquency that points to additional downward pressure on our credit results," clarifying management’s outlook for stable or improving asset quality.
CFO Kochvar stated, "for the next three quarters or so, we think we're in a pretty good spot to handle the rates down should it come," referencing expectations for margin stability in the face of potential rate cuts.
Management addressed competitive deposit pricing pressure, particularly following recent rate cuts, and noted that betas are being closely managed to support margin stability.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Chris McComish:
 Mark, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm going to begin my comments on page three and welcome all of you to our call, especially our analysts. We appreciate you being here with us and look forward to your questions. I also want to thank our employees, shareholders, and others listening to the call, to our leadership team and employees. I want to thank you for all you do. These results are yours, and you should be very proud. Before my remarks on our performance, I want to take a moment to congratulate and thank Christine Tredi, our former Board Chair, for her years of service at S&T Bancorp. As you may be aware, Christine is our new U.S.
Ambassador to Sweden, a well-deserved appointment in recognition of her years of service to our country. I also want to welcome and congratulate Jeff Grube, another longstanding S&T Bancorp board member, as he takes on the role of Lead Independent Director of our Board. We all look forward to working even more closely with Jeff as we move the company forward. Overall, we feel very good about the quarter as it reflects a lot of the work and strategic focus of our team over the past few years, positioning S&T Bancorp for long-term success.
You will see that focus in the numbers we discuss today, including, first, by strategically repositioning our balance sheet over the past couple of years to reduce asset sensitivity, we've enhanced our ability to drive consistent net interest income growth through the interest rate cycle. Second, while total deposits ended basically flat at quarter end, our continued investment in our deposit franchise delivered a solid deposit mix with non-interest-bearing deposits representing 28% of total deposits. Additionally, average DDA growth in the quarter was over $50 million versus Q2, helping to drive our net interest margin expansion, which was already at a very healthy level.
Last, while we did see an increase in NPAs in the quarter, this was over a very low base, and the final numbers remain in a very manageable range. Together, these strategic initiatives have created a solid platform for current strong performance and confidence in our future. Additionally, from a capital standpoint, our earnings drove further tangible book value growth of more than 3% again this quarter, above our already robust capital levels. This capital level gives us a lot of flexibility around acquisitions as well as share buyback opportunities. I will remind everyone again, we have a very clear path to $10 billion and above through organic growth in the coming quarters.
In summary, I'm very excited about how we are executing, delivering for our customers, and building our company for the future. Looking at the quarter, Q3 was another quarter of strong earnings and returns. EPS of $0.91 and net income of $35 million, while ROE, ROA came in at 1.42%, up 10 basis points from Q2. PPNR at a very solid 1.89% was up 16 basis points. PPNR was aided by both NIM expansion increasing to a robust 3.93%, up five basis points late quarter, while net interest income rose more than 3%. Asset growth was a little lighter than Q2 due to some higher payoffs, while NPAs did increase over a very low base.
Charges remained low, and the ACL decreased by one basis point late quarter. David Antolik is here with us, and he will add more color in a few minutes on asset growth and asset quality. Again, while customer deposit growth was somewhat muted, DDA balances remained at an impressive 28%, while total deposits contributed meaningfully to our net interest income and net interest margin improvements. Expenses were well managed. Combined with our revenue growth, the efficiency ratio dropped to 54.4%, another strong number. I'm going to stop there. I don't want to take any more of David or Mark's thunder, and I'll turn it over to them for more details, and I look forward to your questions.
Mark Kochvar:
 Great. Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Continuing on slide four, total loan balances grew by $47 million or 2.3% annually during the quarter. This growth was largely driven by CRE activities, resulting in $133 million of increased balances in that category. Much of this growth was the result of construction loans converting to permanent commercial real estate loans as projects were completed during the quarter. As a result, commercial construction balances declined by $78 million. Looking forward, unfunded construction commitments grew by $37 million during the quarter, pointing towards continued growth in CRE for the balance of the year and beyond. Asset classes experiencing the most growth during the quarter included multifamily, flex mixed-use manufacturing, and retail.
Offsetting our CRE growth were declines in our C&I balances of $46 million. These declines were driven by a combination of modest seasonal utilization reductions, coupled with higher than anticipated payoffs, as Chris mentioned, and credits that we chose to exit. During Q3, total commercial loan payoffs were higher than the previous two quarters and higher than Q3 of 2023. Turning to consumer loan activity, we saw overall growth in line with our expectations at $37 million or approximately 6% annualized. Consumer pipelines were down slightly from Q2 to Q3, but still in line with our forecast and in support of continued growth at the pace that we've seen in recent quarters.
Commercial pipelines continue to grow and sit at the highest point in five quarters. Given our experience in Q3 and anticipated new loan and payoff activity in Q4, we are guiding to mid-single-digit loan growth in Q4. Turning to asset quality on page five, our allowance for credit losses decreased by one basis point and remains appropriate for the level of credit risk in our loan book. Overall, credit size and classified assets were up moderately quarter over quarter and are in a range where we expect them to remain for the foreseeable future. During the quarter, NPAs increased to 62 basis points of total loans.
It's important to note that this level of NPL follows a period of exceptionally low levels and is well within an acceptable range. I'll also note that we do not have concern with any particular asset class, geography, or industry. The increase was primarily a result of two CRE credits and one C&I credit that migrated during the quarter. We have asset resolution strategies in place for several NPLs, and in support of those strategies, recognized charges of $2.4 million in the quarter and established additional specific reserve of $2.7 million. Looking forward, we expect NPLs to stabilize and potentially reduce over the balance of 2024 and into the first quarter of 2025.
Taking a broader look at leading credit risk indicators, we see nothing in our credit risk rating stack, credit scoring, or delinquency that points to additional downward pressure on our credit results. I'll now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Kochvar:
 Hey, thanks, Dave. Third quarter net interest income improved by $2.6 million or 3% compared to the second quarter. Net interest margin expanded by five basis points and combined with loan growth to produce good quarterly revenue growth. The net interest margin improvement came from a one basis point earning asset increase combined with a three basis point decrease in cost of funds. That was mostly due to CD repricings and the higher average DDA balances of $50 million that Chris mentioned. Fed rate change came very late in the quarter, and we did not see any meaningful impact from that in these results.
We continue to expect that our more neutral interest rate risk position and pricing discipline will mitigate any rates down impact, both what has happened so far and what is expected over the next several quarters. Next, on non-interest income, we saw a slight increase, $0.3 million during Q3, with small improvements in our major customer fee categories. Our expectations for fees going forward remain at about $13 to $14 million per quarter. On the expense side, expenses were more in line in the third quarter, declining by $1.7 million compared to the second quarter. Favorable variances were concentrated in salaries and benefits, primarily in incentives and medical.
Additionally, professional services decreased by about a half a million, mostly due to the timing of some projects. Our quarterly expense run rate is still expected to be approximately $57 to $58 million for the next several quarters. Capital to TCE ratio increased by 31 basis points this quarter, with AOCI improvement contributing about seven basis points. Our regulatory ratios increased by about 15 basis points due to strong retained earnings growth. Our TCE and regulatory capital ratios position us well for the environment and will enable us to take advantage of both organic or inorganic growth opportunities. We also have a share repurchase authorization in place for $50 million. Thank you.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for asking questions.
Operator:
 The floor is now open for questions. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone. We ask that while asking your question, please pick up your phone and turn off speaker phone for enhanced audio quality. Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Justin Frank Crowley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Hey, Justin. I wanted to start out on loan growth in the quarter and kind of looking forward. I know you went through some of this, but could you give more of a sense for the puts and takes here between origination activity and then maybe how impactful paydowns were, which I think you called out?
Mark Kochvar:
 Yeah, paydowns were up quarter over quarter and again higher than what we experienced in Q3 of last year. The end result was a little lighter than what we had expected. CRE activity remains strong. As I mentioned, the construction commitments grew during the quarter, pointing towards better growth in Q4 and into Q1. Consumer, we believe, will remain at somewhere in the mid-single digit, similar to the 6% that we experienced in Q3. We're working hard to drive better C&I growth. I talked in earlier quarters about recruiting teams. They're getting up to speed and bringing opportunities to fruition. We feel like that mid-single digit number is appropriate for us, especially given the growth of the deposit franchise.
We don't want to get too far ahead of our funding sources, but we think that's an appropriate level of growth for our bank.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Okay. Taking that mid-single digit versus maybe the mid to high that's been discussed before, is that a function of the paydowns? Is that primarily what that is, or is it also what you're seeing on the deposit side? Maybe it's a combination of the two?
Mark Kochvar:
 It's a combination of all those factors, plus demand in the market. There's still a fair amount of uncertainty. If you think about the budget impasse in Washington, we have the double whammy here in Pennsylvania because we've got a state budget impasse as well. Until some of those things get settled out, I think the interest rate environment's helping us, and we're helping to tell that story to our customers around fixed-rate borrowings. There's still enough uncertainty out there that mid-single digit growth feels more appropriate for us from both a credit and funding perspective.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Okay, got it. That's helpful. Shifting a little bit on the margin, I hear you on the net interest margin being able to hold relatively stable. As we get into next year with more Fed cuts on the way, how do you see that playing out over more the intermediate term in terms of the effect on net interest margin? Maybe also just any color on flexibility with things like swaps continuing to roll off or anything else?
Mark Kochvar:
 Yeah, I mean, I think for the next several quarters, probably through the first half of next year, I feel like we're pretty well positioned to handle any of the potential rate cuts just because of the funding mix that we have, our ability to reduce deposit rates, still CD repricings in the offing, and then also the receipts fixed swap book that we have that will continue to mature its ladder over the next several quarters.
Assuming the Fed kind of finishes up by mid-summer, I think that will be a little bit of a reset, and we'll need to look more closely at how customer behavior, especially on the deposit side, evens out what the shape of the curve is. Those things could put some pressure on the margin just on a go-forward basis in a more stable rate environment. I think a lot of things have to shake out before then. For the next, as I said, for the next three quarters or so, we think we're in a pretty good spot to handle the rates down should it come.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Okay. On the deposit side, as we get these, we're continuing to get these cuts. Do you have any funding or any deposits that are indexed directly to Fed funds and would reprice right away?
Mark Kochvar:
 Not on the deposit side. We've been pretty proactive and have a decent discipline with respect to the exception pricing that we have with our customers. We act fairly quickly on those, but we don't have any contractually indexed deposits.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Okay, helpful.
Mark Kochvar:
 Of any size. We do have a small amount tied to the, like, a three-month T-bill, but that's maybe $100 million, $150 million. Very small.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Okay. I know we talk about it a lot, but on M&A and with the higher levels of activity we're seeing, Chris, could you give us an update just on that side of things for you folks? Are a lot more conversations taking place, or how has that all been trending from your side?
Chris McComish:
 The conversations in the market are still active. Pennsylvania and Ohio may be not as much as other geographies, but there's still a good number of questions, a good number of conversations that are going on. It's a key part of the ongoing outreach and engagement that we have.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Okay. You hit on the geographies, and I know you've cast somewhat of a wide net in terms of what could make sense, but does that leave areas like in the Mid-Atlantic or D.C., Virginia, Maryland?
Chris McComish:
 Exactly. I would think about Mid-Atlantic, west through Ohio. Our marketplace today is Pennsylvania and Ohio, but we certainly are interested in places further south and east.
Justin Frank Crowley:
 Awesome. Thank you so much. I'll leave it there.
Chris McComish:
 Thank you.
Operator:
 Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Hey.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Yeah. Maybe first just on the deposit side. You touched on it, Mark, with your expectation for your ability to maintain the margins in the next several quarters, but just curious what you're seeing on the competition side recently, last few months, and what you're thinking in terms of betas for these cuts that, you know, like the September cut and any future cuts that we have coming.
Mark Kochvar:
 We did, after the first cut here in September, or the last cut in September, see a little bit more competitive pressure than we had expected, particularly on the CD side. There seemed to be a little bit of reluctance on the part of many competitors to reduce some of those shorter-term rates as much as we had expected. We made some adjustments in how we handle some of the exception pricing there. We think that with several cuts, we'll actually catch up. We think there's a little bit of psychology going through the forehandle and customers being attached to getting that forehandle rate. That will improve, assuming that keeps on going with multiple cuts.
On the beta side, our loan beta overall is kind of around 40%. We're targeting right around there or a little bit better over time with the CD repricing included to be able to match that. That's an important part of getting us to have that more stable net interest margin.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Great. Appreciate that. On the $10 billion threshold, with the slower growth in the quarter, it seems like you should be able to stay under $10 billion next quarter, and then, organically, if that's the way you pass, it would be sometime next year?
Chris McComish:
 That's correct. Yep.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Okay. Maybe one for you, Chris, on profitability. You guys have been above 140. We're in the quarter, you know, kind of pretty regularly now for the last few quarters. It seems like that should be relatively sustainable with credit being certainly in a good place. Is that something you think you can stay above, that 140 bogey?
Chris McComish:
 Yeah, I think in that range is certainly the way we're targeting things. To your point, Daniel, as credit continues to behave and we stay focused on that, and then, as Mark talked about, if margins hold up as we expected in this down rate environment, that's certainly a reasonable number and something that we are staying focused on.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Great. Okay, thanks for the color. I'll step back. Appreciate it.
Chris McComish:
 Thank you.
Mark Kochvar:
 Thanks, Dan.
Daniel Tamayo:
 Thanks, Dan.
Operator:
 Your next question comes from the line of David Jason Bishop with Hovde Group. Please go ahead.
David Jason Bishop:
 Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Chris McComish:
 Hey, David.
Mark Kochvar:
 Hey, Dave.
David Jason Bishop:
 I appreciate the color regarding the operating expense forecast. I'm curious, as you budget out into next year, any prospects or plans to recruit or add additional bankers? I'm just curious how much is baked into the numbers and how much of a lift that may influence that on an inflationary basis if you are successful. Thanks.
Mark Kochvar:
 We certainly expect to add bankers, and the expectation is that those bankers pay for themselves. There is a real focus internally on improving productivity. Things like leveraging artificial intelligence and making sure that we have processes streamlined become really important to managing operating expenses. We certainly do expect to add in the customer-facing roles.
David Jason Bishop:
 Got it. I think you mentioned capacity for the share buyback. Just curious, appetite for share repurchases at the current valuation?
Mark Kochvar:
 Yeah, I mean, we think there might be some better opportunities. We've seen a downdraft in bank stocks overall and us in particular over the past month. We certainly think that's something that we're going to look a lot closer at here as we get into the rest of the quarter.
David Jason Bishop:
 Got it. One final sort of housekeeping question. I know there's been a lot of chatter about loans to the NDFI sector. Just curious if there's any exposure you wanted to call out. Thanks.
Mark Kochvar:
 No. Yeah, nothing material. We do have some exposure to some REITs that are technically NDFIs, but nothing that looks like where the problems have surfaced in some of the larger regional banks. That's a space we don't play in.
David Jason Bishop:
 Great. Appreciate the color.
Operator:
 Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Ann Motta with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kelly Ann Motta:
 Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Most of mine have been asked and answered at this point, but I guess piggybacking on the credit question, you did have the migration, although it sounds like you feel levels are low and you feel overall good. Is there any specific areas, understanding you guys don't really have exposure to NDFIs, that you would direct analysts to watch more carefully, either at S&T or just in the bank space more broadly?
Mark Kochvar:
 No, I think, in fact, Kelly, you know, beyond what I mentioned relative to kind of budget crisis, credit is performing as we would have expected. Here in Western Pennsylvania, there are things like a big data center that's being built outside of Indiana here in Homer City, Pennsylvania, that should add additional opportunity for growth and improving credit health in the region as some very large investments are made. We obviously look through our concentrations relative to commercial real estate. We're very comfortable with where we stand from a diversification perspective, both construction versus permanent and all the asset classes.
We're closely managing our C&I book to make sure that we're not getting too far out on our risk scale. That's some of what led to the decline in C&I balances in Q3 were decisions that we made relative to exiting credit. I don't know that there's any one thing that I would point you towards other than kind of general economic and political environment, specifically the budget impasses in Pennsylvania and at the national level.
Kelly Ann Motta:
 Got it. That's helpful. I guess the last question for me would be on the funding side. Your loan-to-deposit ratio sits right just a touch above 100%. If you appreciate the color on the loan outlook, if you look ahead, where are you seeing opportunities to raise core funding and the drivers of that? Thank you.
Chris McComish:
 Yeah, Kelly, excuse me, it's Chris. We've talked about building the growth of our deposit franchise as a key driver of our performance and area of focus. That entails everything from incentive plans to product mix to adding staff. Dave earlier asked about bankers. That includes treasury management professionals and teams. It's a critical part of who we are. We feel really good about our deposit mix, and we feel very good about the process that we use around being proactive relative to exception pricing and ensuring that our bankers are able to be responsive both in the branches with consumers as well as our commercial and business bankers.
It's a core part of what we think about and focus on every day. We know improving that loan-to-deposit ratio is really important to us as we move forward to capitalize on our growth opportunities. As Mark talked about, we did see with the most recent rate cut some increase in competitive intensity. We'll have to be able to respond to those things as well.
Kelly Ann Motta:
 Got it. Thank you. Most of mine were asked. I appreciate all the color today. Thank you so much.
Chris McComish:
 Thank you.
Mark Kochvar:
 Thanks, Kelly.
Operator:
 Your next question comes from Matthew M. Breese with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matthew M. Breese:
 Hey, good afternoon.
Chris McComish:
 Hey, Matt.
Mark Kochvar:
 Hey, Matt.
Matthew M. Breese:
 The first one for me, is it fair to think that the $10 billion crossing will happen either in the first quarter of 2026 or second quarter of 2026 without having to manage the balance sheet below that too strenuously? Is there room to kind of push it even further out?
Mark Kochvar:
 No, I don't think so. I think it'll be first, certainly first half of next year. I don't think there's any. We're going to be pretty close here at the end of the year, but I don't think we'll have to try very hard to stay under at the end of the year. We're not of a mind to do that long term. I think we just go ahead after we get past 2025.
Chris McComish:
 Got it. The other thing, Matt, that we are watching is some of the changes or the proposed changes in Washington relative to regulatory relief for changes in thresholds and that kind of thing. That won't impact the Durbin cost, which we've talked about, which is in that $6 to $7 million range. It certainly makes us feel good about the fact that regardless, we're prepared. It might give us some additional flexibility to run the company.
Chris McComish:
 Got it. Okay. I'm sorry to harp on the net interest margin, but it does seem like, on the back of recent cuts, we could get another 2 to 3, 25 basis point cuts in relatively short order. I think at last count, you have something like 39% or 40% floating rate loans. How do you see the margin? My gut is that the margin has near-term downside before deposits start to catch up and you get some of that back. I was curious on the timing difference between floating rate loans and your ability to act on deposits, if you could help me out on the net interest margin.
Mark Kochvar:
 Yeah, I think our floating has decreased some, especially when you figure in the swap exposure we have. It's closer to 30% net. I think that gives us a little bit of relief. I mean, we run in the models. There is some risk if that competitive piece of the deposit side that we've talked about expands beyond CDs and really starts to bore into, you know, kind of money market and the interest-bearing demand sector. The modeling we've done so far doesn't have that sort of air pocket that you alluded to. We think we can still maintain that fairly quickly with the Fed changes.
Matthew M. Breese:
 Okay. The credits that went nonperforming, could you just give us some insight as to, you know, what business lines were behind the C&I credit and what sectors the commercial real estate credits were attached to? Any kind of underlying factor? Was it, you know, higher rates and just kind of a strain that way, or was it more idiosyncratic?
Mark Kochvar:
 Yeah, Matt, I don't want to get into specific details on these credits because they are active workouts. The C&I credit was a manufacturer. The two CRE credits were really a function of kind of construction-related risk. As I mentioned, we've got asset resolution plans in place that we hope to execute on over the next couple quarters. We don't see anything generally or specifically tied to any industry, geography, or asset class that gives us kind of additional heartburn in terms of more downside risk.
Matthew M. Breese:
 Okay. I appreciate that. Chris, maybe the last one for you. On M&A, you had mentioned kind of geographic preferences. I guess beyond that, what do you make an attractive target? What business lines or deposit composition are you looking for? I guess I'm looking for some color on the strategy component to M&A beyond geography.
Chris McComish:
 Yeah. Strategically, we obviously, I mean, I'm a big believer that your acquisitions are focused primarily on the deposit franchise. That type of opportunity would help with the funding mix that we have today, as well as give us a core group of customers to expand relationships around. We think about it a couple of ways. One, you know, there's geographic expansion that could be into faster growing areas than where we are today. You've got geographic overlap that would create some potential efficiencies for us. Both of those things could be important to us. The key driver really is thinking about that deposit franchise.
There may be a line of business that may help us expand our C&I capabilities, for example, or our focus on small business. Some of that is unique to a specific transaction. We think about the balance sheet makeup of the company first and foremost, a heavy emphasis on the deposit side of the balance sheet, understanding credit risk, and then does it represent an ability to grow the company faster?
Matthew M. Breese:
 Got it. I appreciate all that. Thank you.
Chris McComish:
 Sure thing.
Operator:
 I would like to turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Chris McComish for closing remarks.
Chris McComish:
 Okay. Thanks everybody for your good questions and your engagement. We really appreciate it and your interest in our company and all you're doing to support what we're trying to do. We look forward to being with you again next quarter. In the meantime, we're going to go back to work and see what we can do to grow the bank. Have a great day.
Operator:
 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
